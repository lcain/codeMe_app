### codeMe!

Thanks for visiting!

codeMe was my final project for General Assembly. The idea for codeMe comes from when I was a teenager and could edit my MySpace and Neopets pages with html. I wanted to create something that users could interact with and have the page live render the HTML so users could see exactly what was happening. 

This was created with JS/jQuery, and Ruby on Rails. 

Users also have the ability to save up to five different HTML views and share with their friends. When viewing a different users page you can still see their HTML and edit the code, but you are not allowed to save it. 

I am currently still working on a tutorial to go along with the app.
